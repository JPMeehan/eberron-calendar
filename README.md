# Unofficial Eberron Calendar for FoundryVTT

A simple implementation of the calendar from the Eberron Campaign Setting using the Foundry v13 Calendar Config. This module does not include any interface for interacting with or using this calendar info; it only provides the relevant day/month/year data for use in other applications that actually display the registered calendar data.
